## Introduction

MedChain AI represents a paradigm shift in healthcare technology, combining the immutable trust of blockchain with the privacy-preserving intelligence of federated learning. This comprehensive web application addresses critical challenges in modern healthcare: data fragmentation, privacy concerns, interoperability issues, and the need for AI-driven insights while maintaining patient autonomy.

Unlike traditional centralized healthcare systems that force patients to relinquish control of their medical data, MedChain AI empowers patients as the primary custodians of their health information. Through blockchain-based smart contracts, patients maintain granular control over who accesses their data, for what purpose, and for how long, while enabling secure collaboration between healthcare providers, researchers, and AI systems.

The application serves four distinct user types through specialized portals: patients who monitor their health and manage data permissions, doctors who access authorized patient data and receive AI-powered clinical insights, researchers who contribute to federated learning models using anonymized data, and administrators who oversee system operations and ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.

- High throughput suitable for healthcare applications
- Byzantine fault tolerance for network security
- Energy efficiency compared to proof-of-work systems

### Smart Contract Framework

#### Consent Management Contracts
Smart contracts automate consent management, ensuring that data access permissions are enforced programmatically:

```solidity
contract ConsentManager {
    struct Consent {
        address patient;
        address grantee;
        string[] dataTypes;
        uint256 expirationTime;
        bool isActive;
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => Consent) public consents;
    
    function grantConsent(
        address grantee,
        string[] memory dataTypes,
        uint256 duration
    ) public returns (bytes32 consentId) {
        // Implementation details
    }
    
    function revokeConsent(bytes32 consentId) public {
        // Implementation details
    }
    
    function verifyAccess(
        bytes32 consentId,
        string memory dataType
    ) public view returns (bool) {
        // Implementation details
    }
}
```

#### Audit Trail Contracts
All system interactions are recorded on the blockchain for complete transparency:

```solidity
contract AuditTrail {
    struct AuditEntry {
        address actor;
        string action;
        bytes32 resourceId;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes32 dataHash;
    }
    
    AuditEntry[] public auditLog;
    
    function recordAccess(
        string memory action,
        bytes32 resourceId,
        bytes32 dataHash
    ) public {
        // Implementation details
    }
}
```

### Data Integrity and Provenance
